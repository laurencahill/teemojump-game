Teemo Jump!

A super silly game by Eran Usha  + Lauren Cahill.

Teemo Jump is a single player game with a simple set of goals: collect the flying mushrooms to gain 5 points in score, and avoid the flying saplings or sacrifice 10 points in overall health score. Health score starts out at 100, and score starts out at 0.

Use the right + left arrow keys on your keyboard to move Teemo, and the spacebar key to jump Teemo. 

When Teemo’s health points reach zero, the game is over. Beat your own time and high score!
